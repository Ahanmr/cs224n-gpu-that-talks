- Document params file parameters
- Test training script 
    for positional encoding
- Fix deprecated WARNING: switch to tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession
- Fix queue parameter tuning during training / edit dsp_utils, data_load to use only TF API and use tf.data pipeline
- implement dropout, layernorm / other training tricks
